# cosect

Status: Future-ware, ambitions defined.

Cosect is a privacy-preserving tool using Private Set Intersection (PSI) in order to allow two trusted parties to securely and efficiently identify overlapping data (such as observables like domains, hashes, or IPs) without exposing their full datasets.

## Use Case
Cosect is ideal for scenarios where two parties:
- Trust each other's intentions but cannot or do not want to share their entire dataset.
- Need to check for overlaps in sensitive information like:
  - Customer lists
  - Threat intelligence observables (domains, IPs, hashes, etc.)

## Roadmap
- [x] Define ambitions and scope
- [x] Define technical approach for PSI.
- [ ] Develop proof-of-concept client-server model.
- [ ] Implement encryption and authentication.
- [ ] Implement PSI
- [ ] Improve usability (better CLI options, integration support).
- [ ] Explore API or plugin-based extensions.
- [ ] Add test cases and validation.
- [ ] Improve documentation and usability.

## Cosect Project Scope

### **1. Project Overview**
Cosect is a privacy-preserving tool designed to enable two parties with an existing but limited trust level to securely identify overlapping data (such as threat intelligence observables) without exposing their full datasets. It leverages **Private Set Intersection (PSI)** to ensure only necessary data is shared while maintaining strong encryption.

### **2. Problem Statement**
In cybersecurity and threat intelligence sharing, two well-intentioned parties often face the challenge of needing to compare sensitive data while minimizing data exposure. Currently, the available solutions either:
- Require sharing full datasets, which is often unacceptable.
- Use simple hashing methods that do not provide true anonymity.
- Lack user-friendly and efficient implementation for real-world usage.

Cosect aims to fill this gap by providing an easy-to-use tool that ensures **privacy-first data sharing** using proper cryptographic PSI methods.

### **3. Target Users & Use Cases**
#### **Primary Users:**
- SOC analysts, CTI professionals, MSSPs, IT security teams.
- Researchers or investigative teams handling sensitive information.

#### **Example Use Case:**
1. **Threat Intelligence Sharing**: One party has a list of **compromised domains** obtained via threat actor monitoring, while the other party has a list of **customer domains**. Both want to know if any compromised domains belong to customers **without revealing their entire datasets**.
2. **Fraud Detection**: Financial institutions comparing customer fraud reports.
3. **Privacy-Preserving Collaboration**: Organizations checking for shared breaches or indicators of compromise.

### **4. Privacy & Security Considerations

- Cosect implements **symmetric PSI**: both sides encrypt, exchange, and process data.
- Each participant uses a fresh key pair per session.
- No plaintext is ever shared; all comparisons happen on encrypted values.
- Only matching elements are revealed (locally) after double encryption.**
- **Data Exposure Policy:** Only overlapping data is revealed to both parties.
- **Metadata Leakage:** Parties may pad their dataset with dummy values to obscure actual dataset size.
- **Trust Model:** Cosect assumes a semi-trusted environment where parties have an agreement in place but still require technical safeguards.
- **Adversarial Behavior:** Malicious behavior is discouraged through external agreements and consequences.

### **5. Supported Data Types**
Cosect will process simple **lists of strings**, including:
- **Threat Intelligence Observables**: Domains, IPs, file hashes.
- **Other Use Cases (Future Consideration)**: Emails, usernames, transaction IDs.

### **6. Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**
#### **Scope of First Release:**
- Command-line utility with **client-server architecture**.
- PSI-based comparison over **encrypted TCP connection**.
- Mutual authentication to ensure partiesâ€™ identities.
- Input/output via standard pipes or files.

### **7. Cryptographic & Security Considerations

- Cosect implements **symmetric PSI**: both sides encrypt, exchange, and process data.
- Each participant uses a fresh key pair per session.
- No plaintext is ever shared; all comparisons happen on encrypted values.
- Only matching elements are revealed (locally) after double encryption.**
- **Cryptographic PSI Methods:** TBD after further consultation.
- **Basic Requirement:** Must offer stronger privacy than simple hashing (SHA-256, Bloom filters, etc.).
- **Encryption & Authentication:** Mandatory encryption and mutual authentication for secure data transmission.
