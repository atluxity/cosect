# cosect

Status: Future-ware, ambitions defined.

Cosect is a privacy-preserving tool using Private Set Intersection (PSI) in order to allow two trusted parties to securely and efficiently identify overlapping data (such as observables like domains, hashes, or IPs) without exposing their full datasets.

## Use Case
Cosect is ideal for scenarios where two parties:
- Trust each other's intentions but cannot or do not want to share their entire dataset.
- Need to check for overlaps in sensitive information like:
  - Customer lists
  - Threat intelligence observables (domains, IPs, hashes, etc.)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Define ambitions and scope
- [ ] Review this roadmap
- [ ] Consult Secure Dev documentation and OWASP testing guide
- [ ] Define process
- [ ] Identify libraries and supporting technology
- [ ] Make a minimum viable product without encryption
- [ ] Add encryption
- [ ] Add unit tests and examples.
- [ ] Improve documentation and usability.
